# Aquarium Feeder
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
Ideally raising fish at home and running a fish farm is a more common practice today.​Raising a fish generally undergoes a not-easy maintenance process.​
For example, think of a small fish tank. We’d have to feed the fish once or twice a day and the feed should be maintained in a standard quantity and follow a particular time schedule.​
Considering people in the working​ class they would have no time to ​maintain the fish.​And most people generally do not prefer to touch the fish.​ If you manage a fish farm dieting the ​fish is a difficult and tedious task.​
<h2>Objective</h2>
Our objective is, we will be reducing the time and work consumed by introducing an automated product to take control of the feeding process.
We would automate the fish feeding process by introducing a programmable controller in this application Instead of a legacy system.
We have introduced Stock monitoring and a warning system for intimation of minimal stock through an application based solution to make the system reliable.

<h2>Design and Execution</h2>
-->The fish feeder will have a container that has the feed. It also has a reserve that activates if the main feed gets emptied.
-->The fish feeder will be kept on top end of the fish farm. It will dispense the food in aperiodic interval of time.
-->The project consists of an application which programs the device controls for thedispensing of the food.
-->The user will get an intimation through the GSM module when the feed is low or atcritical level(about to over).
-->The application user interface is easy to access and user can set the quantity of foodand which time it needs to be released.
-->An attractive dashboard is displayed which shows the feed quantity in a graphicalrepresentation.
-->The device contains worm gear which is the delivery setup and used to dispense feedin precise quantity.
-->Once the feed is deposited in the dispense box there will be a blower which scattersthe feed across the farm.
-->If both reserve and main feed gets over there will be an alert sent to the app.
